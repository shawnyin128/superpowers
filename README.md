# SP Harness

A harness engineering skills library forked from [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). Enhanced with structured memory, three-agent development, feature tracking, and systematic quality control.

## What's Different from Upstream

| Feature | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **init-project** | Bootstraps lean CLAUDE.md (~50 lines) with First-Principles Standards, Context Management, and a docs/ directory tree as project map. Replaces the old fps + init-mem skills. |
| **Structured memory** (update-mem) | memory.md is a state snapshot (Current State / Key Decisions / Findings), not an append-only log. New sessions recover context in 30 seconds. |
| **Feature tracker** | Incremental development: picks highest-priority feature from docs/features.json, drives implementation, triggers hygiene and feedback automatically. |
| **Three-agent development** | Planner (Opus) → Generator (Sonnet) → Evaluator (Opus) with JSON-based file communication. Planner produces paired task-plan.json + eval-plan.json with per-task evaluation methods. Evaluator outputs structured eval-report.json for iteration. |
| **Divergence risk analysis** | Brainstorming identifies non-deterministic components, builds risk matrix and divergence trees. Writing-plans designs fallback chains (detection → recovery → safe stop). |
| **Test strategy selection** | TDD skill enhanced with 3-question thinking path to choose test type (unit/integration/e2e/browser) per feature. Coverage maps feature steps to tests. |
| **Git convention** | `[module]: description` commit format so git log serves as context source for new sessions. |
| **Code hygiene** | Lightweight GC-style cleanup every 3 features: removes dead code, fixes naming drift, extracts constants. Auto-fixes small issues, escalates large ones. |
| **System feedback** | Full 4-dimension review (performance, UX, code quality, architecture) after all features complete. File-level optimization report. |
| **Framework check** | Health check + auto-migration. Detects old format CLAUDE.md and rewrites from template. Validates memory, hooks, docs structure. |
| **Output efficiency** | Drops filler, pleasantries, hedging from all responses. Code and technical terms unchanged. |

## Workflow

```
/init-project              Bootstrap CLAUDE.md + docs/ + memory + hooks
       ↓
/brainstorming             Design → spec + features.json
       ↓
/feature-tracker           Picks feature → loops through development
       ↓
  ┌─ three-agent-development ──────────────────────┐
  │  Planner  → task-plan.json + eval-plan.json    │
  │  Generator → subagent-driven-dev → impl report │
  │  Evaluator → eval-report.json                  │
  │  ITERATE? → Planner re-plans → loop            │
  │  PASS?    → mark feature complete              │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
       ↓
  code-hygiene (every 3 features)
       ↓
  next feature → repeat
       ↓
  all features done → /system-feedback
```
