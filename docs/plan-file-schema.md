# Plan File Schema

The shared communication file for Planner, Generator, and Evaluator.

**Location:** `.claude/agents/state/active/<feature-id>.plan.yaml`

Each agent appends to this single file. Fields are scoped to agent ownership
— no agent modifies another agent's section. This is the source of truth
across the entire development cycle.

**User never reads this file directly.** Each agent is responsible for
producing a condensed human-readable terminal summary for user review.
The YAML file is for machine-to-machine communication.

## Agent Write Permissions

| Section | Planner | User (via orch) | Generator | Evaluator |
|---------|---------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| `plan_id`, `iteration`, `based_on` | write | — | — | — |
| `problem`, `steps` | write | — | — | — |
| `decisions[].question/view/confidence/rationale/alternatives/ask_user` | write | — | — | — |
| `decisions[].user_decision` | — | write | — | — |
| `execution`, `unplanned_changes`, `flags_for_eval` | — | — | write | — |
| `eval.rounds[]`, `eval.optimization` | — | — | — | write (append) |

Violations of this table are schema errors — agents must refuse to write
outside their section.

## Round vs Iteration

- **Round** = one Evaluator cycle (after Generator's first implementation
  or after a bug-fix). Rounds accumulate in `eval.rounds[]`.
- **Iteration** = full replan (new `plan_id.plan.yaml` or increment `iteration`
  field). Triggered only when user chooses "replan" — Generator can't
  satisfy the plan after multiple rounds.

Max rounds per iteration = 5. Beyond that, orchestrator MUST escalate to
user with 3 choices: keep iterating / replan / force-merge.

---

## File Lifecycle

1. **Planner** creates the file at `.claude/agents/state/active/<feature-id>.plan.yaml`.
2. **Orchestrator** fills `decisions[].user_decision` based on user answers to
   Planner's terminal asks.
3. **Generator** reads the file, implements, appends `execution`,
   `unplanned_changes`, `flags_for_eval`.
4. **Evaluator** reads the file, runs tests, appends a new `eval.rounds[]` entry.
5. If ITERATE and user picks "fix": Generator updates its sections
   (by appending a new round within same execution or resetting step status).
   Evaluator appends a new round. Repeat.
6. On PASS: Evaluator runs optimization phase, appends `eval.optimization`.
7. On merge: file is archived to `archive/<feature-id>/<feature-id>.plan.yaml`.
8. On replan: file moves to `archive/<feature-id>/<feature-id>.iter-<N>.plan.yaml`,
   fresh file created with `iteration: N+1`.

## Terminal Output Conventions

Each agent produces a human-readable summary to terminal (NOT by dumping this
file). Schema-conformant agent templates define exactly what the terminal
should contain. The file is for agents; the terminal is for the user.

Design principles for terminal output:
1. **Never dump raw YAML** — user reads natural language + multi-choice
   decisions only.
2. **Ask only what must be asked** — decisions with `ask_user: false` are
   shown as FYI, not as questions.
3. **One decision per touch point** — never more than one multi-choice per
   terminal output.
4. **Details in the file, signals in the terminal** — test failure input/output
   goes to file; user sees failure names or high-level description.
