  Incremental feature development orchestrator. Reads docs/features.json,
  picks the highest-priority unfinished feature, and drives it through
  the brainstorming → writing-plans → executing-plans pipeline. Updates
  feature status and memory.md after completion. Use when starting a
  development session or when the current feature is done and you need
  to pick the next one.

# feature-tracker

Orchestrate incremental development by working through features one at a time.

---

## Step 1: Read context

Read these in order:

1. `.claude/mem/memory.md` — current state, what was last worked on
2. `.claude/mem/todo.md` — open problems
3. `git log --oneline -20` — recent commits
4. `docs/features.json` — the feature list

If `docs/features.json` does not exist, inform the user and suggest running
brainstorming first to create one.

---

## Step 2: Show progress summary

Present a brief status to the user:

```
Feature Progress: X/Y completed

Remaining (by priority):
  [high]   feature-id — description
  [medium] feature-id — description
  [low]    feature-id — description
```

---

## Step 3: Pick next feature

Select the highest-priority feature where `passes: false`.

Priority order: high → medium → low. Within the same priority, use array order.

Present the selected feature to the user:

```
Next: [feature-id] — description
Priority: high
Steps:
  1. step one
  2. step two
  ...
```

Ask: "Ready to start this feature, or do you want to pick a different one?"

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 4: Invoke three-agent-development

Invoke `superpowers:three-agent-development` with the selected feature.

Three-agent-development handles the entire implementation cycle:
- Planner (designs plan + eval criteria, discovers implicit requirements)
- Generator (executes plan via subagent-driven-development)
- Evaluator (assesses feature completion, triggers iteration if needed)
- Iteration loop until PASS or REJECT

When three-agent-development returns PASS, the feature is marked complete
in features.json and feature-tracker proceeds to Step 5.

If REJECT, feature-tracker stops and reports to user.

---

## Step 5: Update memory, hygiene check, pick next

Update `.claude/mem/memory.md` Current State to reflect completion.

**Hygiene check:** Count how many features have completed since the last
code-hygiene run. If the count reaches 3 (or user-configured interval),
invoke the **code-hygiene** skill before picking the next feature.

Then return to Step 2 to show updated progress and pick the next feature.

If all features pass:
```
All features complete. docs/features.json shows X/X passing.
Invoking system-feedback for optimization review.
```
Then invoke the **system-feedback** skill for a comprehensive system-level review.

---

## Rules

1. One feature per cycle — do not batch multiple features
2. Verification is handled by three-agent-development's Evaluator — do not
   mark passes: true without Evaluator PASS verdict
3. Never skip the user confirmation in Step 3
4. If a feature turns out to be too large during implementation, pause and
   split it into sub-features in features.json before continuing
5. If implementation reveals a new feature that is needed, add it to
   features.json with appropriate priority — do not scope-creep the current feature
