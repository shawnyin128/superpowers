  Incremental feature development orchestrator. Reads docs/features.json,
  picks the highest-priority unfinished feature, and drives it through
  the brainstorming → writing-plans → executing-plans pipeline. Updates
  feature status and memory.md after completion. Use when starting a
  development session or when the current feature is done and you need
  to pick the next one.

# feature-tracker

Orchestrate incremental development by working through features one at a time.

---

## Step 1: Read context

Read these in order:

1. `.claude/mem/memory.md` — current state, what was last worked on
2. `.claude/mem/todo.md` — open problems
3. `git log --oneline -20` — recent commits
4. `docs/features.json` — the feature list

If `docs/features.json` does not exist, inform the user and suggest running
brainstorming first to create one.

---

## Step 2: Show progress summary

Present a brief status to the user:

```
Feature Progress: X/Y completed

Remaining (by priority):
  [high]   feature-id — description
  [medium] feature-id — description
  [low]    feature-id — description
```

---

## Step 3: Pick next feature

Select the highest-priority feature where `passes: false`.

Priority order: high → medium → low. Within the same priority, use array order.

Present the selected feature to the user:

```
Next: [feature-id] — description
Priority: high
Steps:
  1. step one
  2. step two
  ...
```

Ask: "Ready to start this feature, or do you want to pick a different one?"

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 4: Drive implementation

Based on the feature's complexity:

**If the feature needs design work** (new architecture, unclear approach):
→ Invoke brainstorming skill, scoped to this specific feature

**If the feature is well-defined** (steps are clear, approach is obvious):
→ Invoke writing-plans skill directly, using the feature's steps as requirements

**If the feature is small enough** (1-2 simple steps):
→ Invoke executing-plans skill or implement directly with TDD

The feature's `steps` field provides both the implementation guidance and the
verification criteria. Every step must pass for the feature to be marked complete.

---

## Step 5: Verify completion

After implementation, go through each step in the feature and verify it:

- Run relevant tests
- Check the behavior described in each step
- If any step fails, fix before proceeding

Only proceed to Step 6 if ALL steps pass.

---

## Step 6: Update feature status

Update `docs/features.json`: set `passes: true` for the completed feature.

Commit the change:
```
[features]: mark feature-id as complete
```

---

## Step 7: Update memory and pick next

Update `.claude/mem/memory.md` Current State to reflect completion.

Then return to Step 2 to show updated progress and pick the next feature.

If all features pass:
```
All features complete. docs/features.json shows X/X passing.
Invoking system-feedback for optimization review.
```
Then invoke the **system-feedback** skill for a comprehensive system-level review.

---

## Rules

1. One feature per cycle — do not batch multiple features
2. Always verify before marking passes: true
3. Never skip the user confirmation in Step 3
4. If a feature turns out to be too large during implementation, pause and
   split it into sub-features in features.json before continuing
5. If implementation reveals a new feature that is needed, add it to
   features.json with appropriate priority — do not scope-creep the current feature
