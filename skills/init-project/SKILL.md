  Bootstrap a new project with a lean, map-style CLAUDE.md (~50 lines),
  structured memory in .claude/mem/, and update-mem hooks. Use when starting
  any new project or onboarding an existing codebase. Scans the repo to
  generate a project map automatically. Safe to re-run: skips completed steps.

# init-project

Bootstrap a project with a lean CLAUDE.md and structured memory system.
Run once per project. Re-running is safe — completed steps are skipped.

---

## Step 0: Check what is already done

Check the following independently. Record results to skip completed steps.

- **A**: Does `CLAUDE.md` exist with all three required sections?
  Look for: `First-Principles`, `Context Management`, `Project Map`.
- **B**: Does `.claude/mem/` exist with `memory.md` and `todo.md`?
- **C**: Are Stop and UserPromptSubmit hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json`?

If all are done, report "All steps already complete." and stop.

---

## Step 1: Scan the project

Examine the repository to understand what this project is. Read (if they exist):

- `README.md` or `README.*` — project purpose
- `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, etc. — language, build/test commands
- Top-level directory listing — key directories and their purpose
- `docs/` directory listing — existing documentation

Extract:

1. **Project name**
2. **Quick commands**: build, test, lint, dev server (from package.json scripts, Makefile, etc.)
3. **Key directories**: what each top-level directory contains (1-line each)
4. **Docs index**: list of files in docs/ with brief description (from filename or first heading)

If the project is empty or has no recognizable structure, ask the user to describe
what the project will be. Use their answer for the Project Map section.

---

## Step 2: Create CLAUDE.md

If `CLAUDE.md` already exists with all three sections (check A), skip this step.

If `CLAUDE.md` exists but is incomplete, **merge** missing sections in — do not
overwrite existing content.

If `CLAUDE.md` does not exist, create it with this structure:

```markdown
# <Project Name>

## First-Principles Standards

Before writing any code, internalize these standards. They override all other
conventions.

**1. Clarify before acting.**
If the motivation or goal is unclear, stop and ask. Do not infer intent from
context and proceed silently. A wrong implementation that compiles is worse than
no implementation.

**2. Shortest path wins.**
If the requested approach is not the most direct solution, say so immediately.
State the better alternative, explain the tradeoff in one sentence, and wait for
a decision before writing code.

**3. Fix root causes, not symptoms.**
When something breaks, find out why before touching code. No defensive
programming, no try/except patches, no "just add a check here". Every decision
must answer "why does this solve the root problem?"

**4. Output only what changes decisions.**
Skip preamble, summaries of what you just did, and obvious observations. If a
fact does not affect the next action, omit it.

---

## Context Management

Project memory lives in `.claude/mem/`. memory.md is a structured state
snapshot (not a log) — always rewrite to reflect current state.

**Session start protocol — read these in order:**
1. `.claude/mem/memory.md` — current state, key decisions, findings
2. `.claude/mem/todo.md` — open problems and deferred tasks
3. `git log --oneline -20` — recent commits (uses `[module]: description` format)
4. `docs/features.json` — feature progress (if exists)

**Update rules:**
- Update memory.md (especially Current State) after every non-trivial task
- Keep memory.md under ~40 lines — compress, never let it become a changelog
- Every commit follows `[module]: description` convention

---

## Project Map

<Quick commands — only if detected>

### Architecture
<Key directories with 1-line descriptions, generated from Step 1>

### Docs
- Design docs → docs/design-docs/ (specs from brainstorming)
- Active plans → docs/plans/active/
- Completed plans → docs/plans/completed/
- Feature progress → docs/features.json
- Reports → docs/reports/
<Additional docs found during scan, if any>
```

**Rules:**
- Total CLAUDE.md MUST stay under 80 lines. If the project map is large,
  summarize — list only the most important directories.
- Do not add sections beyond the three above.
- Quick commands: use `command | command` inline format, not a table.
- The Docs subsection must always include the five standard entries above,
  plus any project-specific docs found during the scan.

---

## Step 3: Create docs directory structure

Create the standard documentation hierarchy if it does not exist:

```
docs/
├── design-docs/       ← specs from brainstorming
├── plans/
│   ├── active/        ← plans currently being executed
│   └── completed/     ← finished plans (moved here after completion)
└── reports/           ← system-feedback and optimization reports
```

Skip any directories that already exist. Do not overwrite existing content.

If the project already has docs in a different structure (e.g.,
`docs/superpowers/specs/`), leave them in place — the new structure
is for new documents going forward.

---

## Step 4: Create `.claude/mem/` files

If `.claude/mem/` already exists with both files (check B), skip this step.

Create any missing files:

**`.claude/mem/memory.md`:**
```markdown
# Project Memory

## Current State
Project just initialized. No work started yet.

## Key Decisions

## Findings
```

**`.claude/mem/todo.md`:**
```markdown
# Todo
```

Do not overwrite existing files.

---

## Step 5: Configure hooks

If hooks are already configured (check C), skip this step.

Create `.claude/hooks/update-mem-reminder.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cat <<'EOF'
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MEMORY UPDATE CHECK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After this response:
1. Did you make a design decision, find a root cause, or produce a result?
   → Update .claude/mem/memory.md
2. Did you find a new problem or resolve an existing one?
   → Update .claude/mem/todo.md

Skip if this was a trivial task (typo fix, formatting, single-line edit).
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
EOF
```

Make it executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/update-mem-reminder.sh`

Get the absolute path: `<project_root>/.claude/hooks/update-mem-reminder.sh`

Configure `.claude/settings.json` with both `Stop` and `UserPromptSubmit` hooks.
If settings.json already exists, **merge** — do not overwrite existing hooks.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"<absolute_path_to_hook>\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"<absolute_path_to_hook>\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL**: The path in `command` MUST be wrapped in escaped double quotes
to handle spaces in paths.

---

## Step 6: Confirm

Report a status line for each action:

```
CLAUDE.md                  ✓ created / ✓ updated / ✓ already complete
docs/                      ✓ directory structure created / ✓ already complete
.claude/mem/               ✓ initialized / ✓ already complete
.claude/settings.json      ✓ hooks configured / ✓ already complete
```

---

## Notes

- **Why both Stop AND UserPromptSubmit hooks?** Stop hook output goes to terminal
  only. UserPromptSubmit output is injected into Claude's context as a system
  reminder, which actually triggers the memory check.
- If the project has a PROPOSAL.md (research project), the user should use the
  research-specific init-project skill instead.
- After init completes, the project is ready for development.
