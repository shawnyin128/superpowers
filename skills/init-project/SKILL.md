  Bootstrap a new project with a lean, map-style CLAUDE.md (~50 lines),
  structured state in .claude/, and todo-reminder hooks. Use when starting
  any new project or onboarding an existing codebase. Scans the repo to
  generate a project map automatically. Safe to re-run: skips completed steps.

# init-project

Bootstrap a project with a lean CLAUDE.md and structured memory system.
Run once per project. Re-running is safe — completed steps are skipped.

---

## Step 0: Check what is already done

Check the following independently. Record results to skip completed steps.

- **A**: Does `CLAUDE.md` exist with all three required sections?
  Look for: `First-Principles`, `Context Management`, `Project Map`.
- **B**: Does `.claude/mem/todo.md` exist? (memory.md is deprecated in v0.3.0 — should NOT exist in new projects)
- **C**: Are Stop and UserPromptSubmit hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json`?
- **D**: Does `.claude/sp-harness.json` exist with `dev_mode`?
- **E**: Does `.claude/agents/sp-feedback.md` exist? If dev_mode is three-agent, also check sp-planner.md, sp-generator.md, sp-evaluator.md.

If all are done, report "All steps already complete." and stop.

---

## Step 1: Scan the project

Examine the repository to understand what this project is. Read (if they exist):

- `README.md` or `README.*` — project purpose
- `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, etc. — language, build/test commands
- Top-level directory listing — key directories and their purpose
- `docs/` directory listing — existing documentation

Extract:

1. **Project name**
2. **Quick commands**: build, test, lint, dev server (from package.json scripts, Makefile, etc.)
3. **Docs tree**: full directory tree of docs/ — every subdirectory and file
4. **Codebase tree**: top-level directories and key subdirectories with a few
   words each (e.g., `src/api/ — REST endpoints`). Keep it brief.

If the project is empty or has no recognizable structure, ask the user to describe
what the project will be. Use their answer for the Project Map section.

---

## Step 2: Create CLAUDE.md

If `CLAUDE.md` already exists with all three sections (check A), skip this step.

If `CLAUDE.md` exists but is incomplete, **merge** missing sections in — do not
overwrite existing content.

If `CLAUDE.md` does not exist, create it using the EXACT template below.

**STRICT RULES — read before writing:**
- Copy the template EXACTLY. Do not rearrange, rename, or add sections.
- The ONLY parts you fill in are marked with `{FILL}`. Everything else is literal.
- Do NOT add: Key References, tables, extra headings, summaries, language
  preferences, "respond in X language", or ANY content not in the template.
- Total CLAUDE.md MUST stay under 80 lines.
- If you are tempted to "improve" the template — stop. Use it as-is.

### Template (copy exactly, fill in `{FILL}` parts only):

````markdown
# {FILL: project name}

## First-Principles Standards

**1. Clarify before acting.**
If the goal is unclear, stop and ask. Do not infer intent silently.

**2. Shortest path wins.**
If a better approach exists, say so and wait for a decision.

**3. Fix root causes, not symptoms.**
Find out why before touching code. No defensive patches.

**4. Output only what changes decisions.**
Skip preamble, summaries, and obvious observations.

---

## Context Management

State lives in structured files — each concern has one authoritative source.

**Session start — read in order:**
1. `CLAUDE.md` — this file (map + principles)
2. `.claude/features.json` — feature list and status
3. `.claude/sp-harness.json` — dev mode + hygiene counter (if exists)
4. `.claude/mem/todo.md` — open problems and next actions
5. `git log --oneline -20` — recent activity
6. `git status` — uncommitted work (where you physically left off)

**Rules:** commits use `[module]: description` format. Keep todo.md under
~50 lines — project-level todos go in `.claude/features.json` as features,
not todos. Design rationale goes in `docs/design-docs/`, not todo.md.

---

## Project Map

{FILL: commands from package.json/Makefile, e.g. "build: npm run build | test: npm test". Omit this line entirely if no build system found.}

### Design Docs
{FILL: tree listing of docs/ showing every subdirectory and file, e.g.:
docs/
├── design-docs/
│   └── (empty)
├── plans/
│   ├── active/
│   └── completed/
└── reports/
}

### Codebase
{FILL: directory tree of code dirs, a few words per entry, e.g.:
src/api/        — REST endpoints
src/models/     — data layer
tests/          — pytest suite
}
````

---

## Step 3: Create docs directory structure

Create the standard documentation hierarchy if it does not exist:

```
docs/
├── design-docs/       ← specs from brainstorming
├── plans/
│   ├── active/        ← plans currently being executed
│   └── completed/     ← finished plans (moved here after completion)
└── reports/           ← sp-feedback optimization reports
```

Skip any directories that already exist. Do not overwrite existing content.

If the project already has docs in a different structure (e.g.,
`docs/sp-harness/specs/`), leave them in place — the new structure
is for new documents going forward.

---

## Step 4: Create `.claude/mem/todo.md`

If `.claude/mem/todo.md` already exists (check B), skip this step.

Create `.claude/mem/todo.md`:

```markdown
# Todo

Open problems and next actions for the main session. Project-level features
belong in `.claude/features.json`, not here. Design rationale belongs in
`docs/design-docs/`, not here.

## Format

- [ ] Short imperative title
- [x] Completed — one-line resolution

Keep under ~50 lines. Remove completed items beyond the last 10 unless
they have reference value.
```

Do not overwrite existing files.

**If `.claude/mem/memory.md` exists (legacy from pre-0.3.0):** do NOT delete.
Report to user: "Legacy memory.md detected. Review contents and migrate:
design decisions → docs/, open problems → todo.md, patterns → agent-memory
will accumulate naturally. Delete memory.md when migration done."

---

## Step 5: Configure hooks

If hooks are already configured (check C), skip this step.

Create `.claude/hooks/update-todo-reminder.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cat <<'EOF'
TODO CHECK: If this was a non-trivial task and produced a new open problem
or a natural next action, update .claude/mem/todo.md before proceeding.
EOF
```

Make executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/update-todo-reminder.sh`

Get absolute path with `pwd`: `$(pwd)/.claude/hooks/update-todo-reminder.sh`

Configure `.claude/settings.json` with both `Stop` and `UserPromptSubmit` hooks.
If settings.json already exists, **merge** — do not overwrite existing hooks.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"<absolute_path_to_hook>\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"<absolute_path_to_hook>\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL**: The path in `command` MUST be wrapped in escaped double quotes
to handle spaces in paths.

---

## Step 6: Configure development mode and generate project-level agents

All agent definitions are project-level. Plugin ships templates at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agent-templates/sp-*.md`. init-project **always**
generates project-level copies adapted to this project's context.

### Q1: Dev mode

> "Which development mode? (a) Three-agent — Planner, Generator, Evaluator as separate subagents (recommended for complex projects), (b) Single-agent — one agent plays all three roles sequentially (faster, lower token cost)"

### Step 6a: Generate sp-feedback (always, regardless of dev mode)

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agent-templates/sp-feedback.md`. Replace:
- `{PROJECT_NAME}` → project name from CLAUDE.md
- `{PROJECT_CONTEXT}` → 2-4 lines summarizing: stack, key modules, critical
  invariants identified during Step 1 scan

Write to `.claude/agents/sp-feedback.md`.

### Step 6b: If three-agent, generate sp-planner / sp-generator / sp-evaluator

Print defaults from templates:
```
Default three-agent configuration (from agent-templates/):
  sp-planner:   opus, tools=Read/Grep/Glob/Bash/Write/Edit/Skill, memory=project, skills=sp-harness:writing-plans
  sp-generator: sonnet, isolation=worktree, skills=subagent-driven-dev+TDD+git-convention
  sp-evaluator: opus, tools=Read/Grep/Glob/Bash, memory=project
```

**Q2:** "Use these defaults? (yes/no)"

- **If yes:** For each of sp-planner, sp-generator, sp-evaluator:
  Read template from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agent-templates/{name}.md`.
  Replace `{PROJECT_NAME}` and `{PROJECT_CONTEXT}` with project-specific values.
  Write to `.claude/agents/{name}.md`.

- **If no:** For each agent, ask:
  1. "Model?" (opus / sonnet / haiku / inherit)
  2. "Tools?" (default / read-only / custom list)
  3. "Cross-session memory?" (none / project / user / local)
  4. "Isolated worktree?" (yes / no)

  Read template, override frontmatter fields with user answers, fill context,
  write to `.claude/agents/{name}.md`.

### Step 6c: Write config

```json
{"dev_mode": "three-agent" | "single-agent", "last_hygiene_at_completed": 0}
```

to `.claude/sp-harness.json`.

**Single-agent mode note:** only `sp-feedback.md` is generated as a subagent.
Planner/Generator/Evaluator roles are played by main session — no subagent
definitions needed for them.

---

## Step 7: Confirm

Report a status line for each action:

```
CLAUDE.md                  ✓ created / ✓ updated / ✓ already complete
docs/                      ✓ directory structure created / ✓ already complete
.claude/mem/               ✓ initialized / ✓ already complete
.claude/settings.json      ✓ hooks configured / ✓ already complete
.claude/sp-harness.json    ✓ dev_mode={mode} / ✓ already complete
.claude/agents/            ✓ sp-feedback.md + {3 dev agents if three-agent}
```

---

## Notes

- Stop hook: terminal display only. UserPromptSubmit hook: injected into agent context (this is what actually triggers todo checks).
- After init, project is ready for brainstorming.
