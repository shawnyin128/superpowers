  Bootstrap a new project with a lean, map-style CLAUDE.md (~50 lines),
  structured state in .claude/, and todo-reminder hooks. Use when starting
  any new project or onboarding an existing codebase. Scans the repo to
  generate a project map automatically. Safe to re-run: skips completed steps.

# init-project

Bootstrap a project with a lean CLAUDE.md and structured memory system.
Run once per project. Re-running is safe — completed steps are skipped.

---

## Step 0: Check what is already done

Check the following independently. Record results to skip completed steps.

- **A**: Does `CLAUDE.md` exist with all three required sections?
  Look for: `First-Principles`, `Context Management`, `Project Map`.
- **B**: Does `.claude/todos.json` exist? (replaces `.claude/mem/todo.md` from v0.4.0)
- **B2**: Does `.claude/memory.md` exist? (short-term session memory, reintroduced in v0.4.3 with tightened scope)
- **C**: Are Stop and UserPromptSubmit hooks configured in `.claude/settings.json`?
- **D**: Does `.claude/sp-harness.json` exist with `dev_mode` AND `external_codebase` AND `language`?
- **E**: Does `.claude/agents/sp-feedback.md` exist? If dev_mode is three-agent, also check sp-planner.md, sp-generator.md, sp-evaluator.md.

If all are done, report "All steps already complete." and stop.

---

## Step 1: Scan the project

Examine the repository to understand what this project is. Read (if they exist):

- `README.md` or `README.*` — project purpose
- `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, etc. — language, build/test commands
- Top-level directory listing — key directories and their purpose
- `docs/` directory listing — existing documentation

Extract:

1. **Project name**
2. **Quick commands**: build, test, lint, dev server (from package.json scripts, Makefile, etc.)
3. **Docs tree**: full directory tree of docs/ — every subdirectory and file
4. **Codebase tree**: top-level directories and key subdirectories with a few
   words each (e.g., `src/api/ — REST endpoints`). Keep it brief.

If the project is empty or has no recognizable structure, ask the user to describe
what the project will be. Use their answer for the Project Map section.

---

## Step 2: Create CLAUDE.md

If `CLAUDE.md` already exists with all three sections (check A), skip this step.

If `CLAUDE.md` exists but is incomplete, **merge** missing sections in — do not
overwrite existing content.

If `CLAUDE.md` does not exist, create it using the EXACT template below.

**STRICT RULES — read before writing:**
- Copy the template EXACTLY. Do not rearrange, rename, or add sections.
- The ONLY parts you fill in are marked with `{FILL}`. Everything else is literal.
- Do NOT add: Key References, tables, extra headings, summaries, locale
  overrides (e.g. "always respond in Chinese" — Principle 5 reads the
  language from `.claude/sp-harness.json`, set it there instead), or ANY
  content not in the template.
- Total CLAUDE.md MUST stay under 80 lines.
- If you are tempted to "improve" the template — stop. Use it as-is.

### Template (copy exactly, fill in `{FILL}` parts only):

````markdown
# {FILL: project name}

## First-Principles Standards

**1. Clarify before acting.**
If the goal is unclear, stop and ask. Do not infer intent silently.

**2. Shortest path wins.**
If a better approach exists, say so and wait for a decision.

**3. Fix root causes, not symptoms.**
Find out why before touching code. No defensive patches.

**4. Output only what changes decisions.**
Skip preamble and obvious observations. When summarizing plans, specs, or
status, translate jargon — don't paste doc vocabulary back. Cite file:line
at the end if needed, not as the lead.

**5. Inline chat language is configured in `.claude/sp-harness.json`.**
Read the `language` field at session start. Default `match-input` replies
in the user's input language each turn; any other value (e.g. `en`, `zh`)
pins replies to that language regardless of input. No code-mixing in
either case. Identifiers (paths, commands, field names, product names)
stay in original. Files, commits, docs, code, and state always English
regardless.

---

## Context Management

State lives in structured files — each concern has one authoritative source.

**Session start — read in order:**
1. `CLAUDE.md` — this file (map + principles)
2. `.claude/features.json` — feature list and status
3. `.claude/sp-harness.json` — config (dev_mode, hygiene counter, external_codebase flag)
4. `.claude/codebase-context.md` — only if sp-harness.json has `external_codebase: true`
5. `.claude/todos.json` — idea backlog
6. `.claude/memory.md` — short-term buffer (loose notes + in-flight topic blocks)
7. `git log --oneline -20` — recent activity
8. `git status` — uncommitted work (where you physically left off)

**In-flight auto-resume (after step 6):**
If `.claude/memory.md` `## Buffer` section has one or more in-flight topic
blocks (entries beginning with `### <topic-id>`), surface each to the user
before doing anything else:

```
⏸ In-flight detected: <topic-id>
   Phase:   <phase>
   Context: <context>
   Open:    <N> question(s) — <summary>
   Next:    <next action>

Resume this? (y = load pointers and continue from Next; n = skip for now)
```

Act on the user's answer:
- `y`: read each file in `Pointers`, then execute the `Next` action
- `n`: leave the in-flight block untouched, continue with other work

Do NOT assume resume. Always ask.

**Rules:**
- When reporting plan/status to the user, translate project terms into plain language. The listener may not share doc vocabulary.
- commits use `[module]: description` format
- Decided ideas → `.claude/todos.json` (manage-todos)
- Decided requirements → `.claude/features.json` (manage-features)
- Undecided observations → `.claude/memory.md`
- Design rationale → `docs/design-docs/`
- Reusable patterns → raise via sp-feedback (agent-memory)

Each concern has ONE home. Never duplicate across sources.

---

## Project Map

{FILL: commands from package.json/Makefile, e.g. "build: npm run build | test: npm test". Omit this line entirely if no build system found.}

### Design Docs
{FILL: tree listing of docs/ showing every subdirectory and file, e.g.:
docs/
├── design-docs/
│   └── (empty)
├── plans/
│   ├── active/
│   └── completed/
└── reports/
}

### Codebase
{FILL: directory tree of code dirs, a few words per entry, e.g.:
src/api/        — REST endpoints
src/models/     — data layer
tests/          — pytest suite
}
````

---

## Step 3: Create docs directory structure

Create the standard documentation hierarchy if it does not exist:

```
docs/
├── design-docs/       ← specs from brainstorming
├── plans/
│   ├── active/        ← plans currently being executed
│   └── completed/     ← finished plans (moved here after completion)
└── reports/           ← sp-feedback optimization reports
```

Skip any directories that already exist. Do not overwrite existing content.

If the project already has docs in a different structure (e.g.,
`docs/sp-harness/specs/`), leave them in place — the new structure
is for new documents going forward.

---

## Step 4: Create state files

### 4a. `.claude/todos.json` (idea backlog)

If already exists (check B), skip.

Create with empty backlog:
```json
{
  "todos": []
}
```

`todos.json` holds high-level ideas/directions that need brainstorming to
scope into concrete features. Operations via `sp-harness:manage-todos` —
don't hand-edit in ways that break the schema.

### 4b. `.claude/memory.md` (short-term session memory)

If already exists (check B2), skip.

Create with this EXACT content (template + scope comment):

````markdown
# Session Memory (short-term buffer)

<!--
SCOPE: Last-resort short-term buffer per `using-sp-harness` Memory
Discipline. ONLY for content that (a) has no permanent home yet
(design doc / CLAUDE.md / commit / todos.json / features.json) AND
(b) would be lost on session exit.

Delete each entry the moment it reaches a permanent home. This file
is a buffer, not an archive.

WHAT DOES NOT GO HERE (already decided → skip memory, route direct):
  - Ideas to pursue → sp-harness:manage-todos add
  - Bugs to fix → sp-harness:manage-features add (fix_feature)
  - Reusable patterns → raise via sp-feedback (routes to agent-memory)
  - Design decisions → docs/design-docs/
  - Project architecture → CLAUDE.md + docs/

Entries may be loose 1-line notes OR structured in-flight topic blocks
— both live in the single `## Buffer` section below. Examples:

  Loose note:
    - [YYYY-MM-DD] <freeform note> — refs: <file:line / id / commit>

  In-flight topic block (self-sufficient for session resume):
    ### <topic-id>  (paused: <ISO 8601 UTC>)
    - **Phase**: <what stage>
    - **Context**: <1-2 sentences on what was decided and where we are>
    - **Open**: <open questions / decisions>
    - **Pointers**: <file paths / ids the resuming session should read>
    - **Next**: <one sentence describing the next action that resumes this>

BEFORE ADDING (mandatory triage of existing entries):
  For each existing entry, run these checks in order:
    1. `git log --since="<entry timestamp>" -- <referenced-file>` — resolved?
    2. grep todos.json / features.json for entry's key terms — now tracked?
    3. Still undecided? Keep. Otherwise remove.
  Then add the new entry.

HARD RULE: NEVER duplicate with todos.json / features.json / agent-memory.
Keep under 30 lines. If bloated, triage before adding more.

Agent reading this file on session start MUST surface each in-flight
topic block to the user with a resume prompt. Loose notes need no resume
prompt; they are context for whatever the user does next.
-->

## Buffer

<!-- entries go here — loose notes and/or in-flight topic blocks -->
````

### 4c. Legacy cleanup (pre-0.4.x projects)

- If `.claude/mem/todo.md` exists: do NOT delete. Report:
  "Legacy todo.md detected. Transfer ideas to `.claude/todos.json` via manage-todos."
- If `.claude/mem/memory.md` exists: do NOT delete. Report:
  "Legacy memory.md detected (old scope). The new memory.md has a tighter
  scope (short-term pre-triage observations only). Review old content:
  design decisions → docs/, decided ideas → todos.json, decided fixes →
  features.json. After migration, delete the old file."
- `.claude/mem/` directory may become empty after user migrates; they can remove it.

---

## Step 5: Configure hooks

If hooks are already configured (check C), skip this step.

Create `.claude/hooks/update-context-reminder.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cat <<'EOF'
CONTEXT CHECK: If this task surfaced anything worth remembering, route it:
  - Decided idea/direction → sp-harness:manage-todos add (.claude/todos.json)
  - Decided bug to fix → sp-harness:manage-features add with fix_feature
  - Undecided observation (bug/hypothesis/concern/in-flight) → append to
    .claude/memory.md (before adding, triage existing entries against git log
    and other state sources — remove any already-resolved or already-tracked)

Each concern has ONE home. Never duplicate across sources.
EOF
```

Make executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/update-context-reminder.sh`

Get absolute path with `pwd`: `$(pwd)/.claude/hooks/update-context-reminder.sh`

Configure `.claude/settings.json` with both `Stop` and `UserPromptSubmit` hooks.
If settings.json already exists, **merge** — do not overwrite existing hooks.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"<absolute_path_to_hook>\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"<absolute_path_to_hook>\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL**: The path in `command` MUST be wrapped in escaped double quotes
to handle spaces in paths.

---

## Step 6: Configure development mode and generate project-level agents

All agent definitions are project-level. Plugin ships templates at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agent-templates/sp-*.md`. init-project **always**
generates project-level copies adapted to this project's context.

### Q1: Dev mode

This is a decision touch-point per `docs/decision-touchpoint-protocol.md`
(structured menu — both options as one-sentence consequences):

```
→ Pick a development mode for this project:
  (a) Single-agent (default) — one agent plays Planner / Generator /
      Evaluator roles sequentially in the same session; faster, lower
      token cost. Evaluator shares context with implementer, so the
      red-team check is weaker; fits most projects.
  (b) Three-agent — Planner / Generator / Evaluator run as separate
      subagents in their own contexts; stronger evaluator independence
      (true red-team) at higher token cost and dispatch overhead. Pick
      this when correctness matters enough to pay for adversarial review.
```

### Step 6a: Generate sp-feedback (always, regardless of dev mode)

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agent-templates/sp-feedback.md`. Replace:
- `{PROJECT_NAME}` → project name from CLAUDE.md
- `{PROJECT_CONTEXT}` → 2-4 lines summarizing: stack, key modules, critical
  invariants identified during Step 1 scan

Write to `.claude/agents/sp-feedback.md`.

### Step 6b: If three-agent, generate sp-planner / sp-generator / sp-evaluator

Print defaults from templates:
```
Default three-agent configuration (from agent-templates/):
  sp-planner:   opus, tools=Read/Grep/Glob/Bash/Write/Edit/Skill, memory=project, skills=sp-harness:writing-plans
  sp-generator: sonnet, isolation=worktree, skills=subagent-driven-dev+TDD+git-convention
  sp-evaluator: opus, tools=Read/Grep/Glob/Bash, memory=project
```

**Q2:** decision touch-point per protocol — spell out both paths:

```
→ Use the defaults shown above?
  · yes — write the three agent files now using template defaults;
    you can always re-run switch-dev-mode later to customize.
  · no  — I'll walk through the four config knobs (model / tools /
    memory / worktree) for each of the three agents one at a time.
```

- **If yes:** For each of sp-planner, sp-generator, sp-evaluator:
  Read template from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agent-templates/{name}.md`.
  Replace `{PROJECT_NAME}` and `{PROJECT_CONTEXT}` with project-specific values.
  Write to `.claude/agents/{name}.md`.

- **If no:** For each agent, ask:
  1. "Model?" (opus / sonnet / haiku / inherit)
  2. "Tools?" (default / read-only / custom list)
  3. "Cross-session memory?" (none / project / user / local)
  4. "Isolated worktree?" (yes / no)

  Read template, override frontmatter fields with user answers, fill context,
  write to `.claude/agents/{name}.md`.

### Step 6c: External codebase question

> "Is this project an existing codebase that wasn't built through sp-harness?
>  (e.g., legacy code, third-party integration, or a project predating
>  your sp-harness adoption.)
>  - Yes → I'll scan the codebase once and save the structured understanding
>    to `.claude/codebase-context.md` as ground truth for downstream skills.
>  - No → skip; design docs from brainstorming will be the source of truth.
>    You can re-run `init-project` later if external code gets added."

If **Yes** → run a deep scan now (read key source files, identify modules,
find variants, check git activity for active vs stale). Save to
`.claude/codebase-context.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Codebase Context (external, pre-sp-harness)

Generated: <ISO date> by init-project
Scope: <directories scanned>

## Core modules
- <path> — <what it does> [active|stale|deprecated]

## Variants found
- <functionality>: <path A> vs <path B> — <key difference>

## Module dependencies
- <module A> → <module B> for <reason>

## Notes
<anything else worth recording>
```

Set `external_codebase: true` in sp-harness.json (next step).

If **No** → skip scan, do not create the file. Set `external_codebase: false`.

### Step 6d: Inline-chat language

Decision touch-point per `docs/decision-touchpoint-protocol.md` —
structured menu, plain-language consequences:

```
→ What language should the agents reply in for inline chat output?
  · match-input — agents reply in whatever language you typed in this
    turn. Behaves like the original v0.8.7 rule. Pick this if you
    write to the agent in different languages and want it to follow.
  · en (or any specific code: zh, ja, ko, fr, ...) — agents always
    reply in this language regardless of what you typed. Pick this
    if you want session-stable language across context switches.
```

Default offered: `match-input`. Files / commits / docs / plan YAML
always stay English regardless of this choice — this only affects
the chat language between you and the agents.

Save the user's answer as the `language` field in the next step.

### Step 6e: Write config

```json
{
  "dev_mode": "single-agent" | "three-agent",
  "last_hygiene_at_completed": 0,
  "external_codebase": true | false,
  "language": "match-input" | "en" | "zh" | <other>
}
```

to `.claude/sp-harness.json`.

**Single-agent mode note:** only `sp-feedback.md` is generated as a subagent.
Planner/Generator/Evaluator roles are played by main session — no subagent
definitions needed for them.

---

## Step 7: Confirm

Report a status line for each action:

```
CLAUDE.md                  ✓ created / ✓ updated / ✓ already complete
docs/                      ✓ directory structure created / ✓ already complete
.claude/todos.json         ✓ initialized (empty backlog) / ✓ already complete
.claude/memory.md          ✓ initialized (template) / ✓ already complete
.claude/settings.json      ✓ hooks configured / ✓ already complete
.claude/sp-feedback-calibration.json  (auto-created on first sp-feedback run)
.claude/sp-harness.json    ✓ dev_mode={mode}, external_codebase={true|false}, language={lang}
.claude/codebase-context.md  ✓ generated (only if external_codebase=true) / — skipped
.claude/agents/            ✓ sp-feedback.md + {3 dev agents if three-agent}
```

---

## Notes

- Stop hook: terminal display only. UserPromptSubmit hook: injected into agent context (triggers context-routing checks for todos/memory/features).
- After init, project is ready for brainstorming.
