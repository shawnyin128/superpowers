<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, skip this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Instruction Priority

SP Harness skills override default system prompt behavior, but **user instructions always take precedence**:

1. **User's explicit instructions** (CLAUDE.md, direct requests) — highest priority
2. **SP Harness skills** — override default system behavior where they conflict
3. **Default system prompt** — lowest priority

If CLAUDE.md says "don't use TDD" and a skill says "always use TDD," follow the user's instructions. The user is in control.

## Output Efficiency

Cut token waste without sacrificing technical clarity.

**Drop these — they add zero value:**
- Filler: just, really, basically, actually, simply, essentially
- Pleasantries: "Sure, I'd be happy to help", "Of course!", "Certainly"
- Hedging: "it might be worth considering", "you could potentially"
- Redundant phrases: "in order to" → "to", "the reason is because" → "because"

**Keep these unchanged:**
- Code blocks, inline code, commands
- Technical terms, library names, error messages
- Git commits, PR descriptions
- Anything where brevity would create ambiguity

**Prefer:** short words over long (fix not "implement a solution for", use not
"utilize"), direct statements over roundabout explanations, one sentence over
a paragraph when one sentence is enough.

This applies to all responses. Code quality is unaffected — only English prose
gets tightened.

## How to Access Skills

Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.

# Using Skills

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.

```dot
digraph skill_flow {
    "User message received" [shape=doublecircle];
    "About to EnterPlanMode?" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Already brainstormed?" [shape=diamond];
    "Invoke brainstorming skill" [shape=box];
    "Might any skill apply?" [shape=diamond];
    "Invoke Skill tool" [shape=box];
    "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'" [shape=box];
    "Has checklist?" [shape=diamond];
    "Create TodoWrite todo per item" [shape=box];
    "Follow skill exactly" [shape=box];
    "Respond (including clarifications)" [shape=doublecircle];

    "About to EnterPlanMode?" -> "Already brainstormed?";
    "Already brainstormed?" -> "Invoke brainstorming skill" [label="no"];
    "Already brainstormed?" -> "Might any skill apply?" [label="yes"];
    "Invoke brainstorming skill" -> "Might any skill apply?";

    "User message received" -> "Might any skill apply?";
    "Might any skill apply?" -> "Invoke Skill tool" [label="yes, even 1%"];
    "Might any skill apply?" -> "Respond (including clarifications)" [label="definitely not"];
    "Invoke Skill tool" -> "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'";
    "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'" -> "Has checklist?";
    "Has checklist?" -> "Create TodoWrite todo per item" [label="yes"];
    "Has checklist?" -> "Follow skill exactly" [label="no"];
    "Create TodoWrite todo per item" -> "Follow skill exactly";
}
```

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution

"Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
"Fix this bug" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.

## Feedback / adjustment classification

Before acting on a user message, classify by **what the message explicitly
asks for** (not by guessing intent):

1. **Observed-behavior report** — user describes what the system IS doing,
   especially if it contradicts expected behavior.
   Signals: past-tense behavior statements, "I noticed / saw / ran into",
   "X happens when Y", bug-like descriptions without a specified fix.
   → invoke `/feedback` (Mode B: diagnose + route)

2. **New creation** — user asks for a capability / feature / module that
   doesn't exist yet, OR wants to rethink an existing part significantly.
   Signals: "let's add / build / create / design", proposes a new direction.
   → invoke `/brainstorming` (even if user suggests the approach)

3. **Explicit scoped edit** — user specifies WHAT to change and WHERE,
   with no ambiguity. No diagnosis needed, no design decision.
   Signals: "change MAX_RETRIES from 3 to 5 in config.yaml", "rename X to Y",
   "fix the typo on line N".
   → proceed directly

**Self-check (objective test):** "Can I make this change without any
investigation or design decision?"
- Yes → proceed directly (category 3)
- No, need to find root cause → /feedback (category 1)
- No, need to design the approach → /brainstorming (category 2)

**If the message is mixed or ambiguous** (e.g., contains both observation
and a proposed fix, or multiple intents), ASK the user which path they
want before acting. Do not guess and implement.

This rule only applies to user-reported issues / adjustments. Normal
development flow (brainstorming → feature-tracker → dev skills) proceeds
through its own skill triggers, unaffected.

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
