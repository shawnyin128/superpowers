# Three-Agent Development

Three independent agents develop a feature through structured cycles.
Each agent delegates to existing superpowers skills — this skill only
orchestrates the agent dispatch and iteration loop.

```
Planner  → calls writing-plans    → task-plan.json + eval-plan.json
Generator → calls subagent-driven → implementation.md
Evaluator → reads code + reports  → eval-report.json
                  ↕ iteration loop (ITERATE → Planner re-plans)
```

---

## File Structure

All agent communication goes through `.claude/agents/`. Create if missing.

```
.claude/agents/
├── task-plan.json     ← Planner output: implementation plan (Generator reads)
├── eval-plan.json     ← Planner output: evaluation playbook (Evaluator reads)
├── implementation.md  ← Generator output: execution report
└── eval-report.json   ← Evaluator output: structured assessment (JSON)
```

---

## Step 1: Select Feature

Read the feature from `docs/features.json` (passed by feature-tracker,
or specified by user). Read context: `.claude/mem/memory.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
relevant spec document.

---

## Step 2: Dispatch Planner

Dispatch using `./planner-prompt.md`. Use most capable model (e.g. Opus).

**Planner does two things internally:**

1. **Implicit requirements discovery** — scans feature for gaps, asks user
   questions one-at-a-time until resolved. (Logic in planner-prompt.md.)

2. **Plan production** — invokes `superpowers:writing-plans` to generate
   the implementation plan. Follows all writing-plans conventions (TDD steps,
   file structure, no placeholders, fallback chain design).

**Planner writes two JSON files to `.claude/agents/`:**
- `task-plan.json` — implementation plan (from writing-plans, serialized as JSON)
- `eval-plan.json` — evaluation playbook: for each task, specifies method
  (spec-review / code-review / both), quantifiable criteria, and verify commands.

**After writing both files, Planner prints a merged summary table** showing
each task with its description, eval method, and criteria. The orchestrator
waits for user acknowledgment before dispatching Generator.

---

## Step 3: Dispatch Generator

Dispatch using `./generator-prompt.md`. Use standard model (e.g. Sonnet).

**Generator does one thing internally:**

Invokes `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` to execute task-plan.json.
This runs the full existing task-level machinery:
- Fresh implementer subagent per task (using implementer-prompt.md)
- Spec compliance review after each task (using spec-reviewer-prompt.md)
- Code quality review after each task (using code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md)
- TDD cycle for each step

**Generator writes one file to `.claude/agents/`:**
- `implementation.md` — execution report

---

## Step 4: Dispatch Evaluator

Dispatch using `./evaluator-prompt.md`. Use most capable model (e.g. Opus).

**Evaluator parses eval-plan.json and follows it task by task:**
- For each `task_evaluations` entry: uses the specified `method`, checks
  each `criteria` item, runs `verify_commands`
- Does NOT trust Generator's report — reads actual code and runs tests
- After all tasks: evaluates `feature_level_criteria`
- Checks against `acceptance_threshold`
- Can adjust criteria if needed (must document why)

**Evaluator writes one JSON file to `.claude/agents/`:**
- `eval-report.json` — structured report with per-task `criteria_results[]`,
  `verify_results[]`, `iteration_items[]`, and `convergence` status.
  Planner reads this JSON to decide whether and how to iterate.

---

## Step 5: Handle Verdict

### PASS
1. Update `docs/features.json` — set `passes: true`
2. Update `.claude/mem/memory.md` Current State
3. Commit: `[features]: mark {feature-id} as complete`
4. Return to feature-tracker

### ITERATE
1. Read `eval-report.json`: check `convergence.status`
2. **If converging** — dispatch Planner. Planner reads `iteration_items[]`
   and `task_results[].criteria_results[]` to understand what failed.
   Planner revises both `task-plan.json` and `eval-plan.json`.
3. **If diverging** — escalate to REJECT
4. Generator executes revised plan → Evaluator assesses again → loop

### REJECT
1. Stop. Preserve all files in `.claude/agents/`
2. Update `.claude/mem/memory.md` — note rejection and reason
3. Report to user: what was attempted, why it failed, evaluator's assessment

---

## Iteration Divergence Fallback

Track across iterations:
- **Converging:** fewer items, or same items at lower priority
- **Diverging:** more items, new must-fix items, same must-fix persisting 2+ rounds

On divergence → Evaluator sets REJECT with explanation.
All intermediate files preserved for user diagnosis.

---

## Agent Independence

1. Planner never sees implementation.md or eval-report.json (except when
   re-planning after ITERATE — then it reads eval-report.json only)
2. Generator never sees eval-plan.json or eval-report.json
3. Evaluator never sees task-plan.json or the Planner's prompt
4. All communication through `.claude/agents/` files only

## Model Selection

| Agent | Model | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Planner | Most capable (Opus) | Design decisions, requirement analysis |
| Generator | Standard (Sonnet) | Execution — plan is already detailed |
| Evaluator | Most capable (Opus) | Independent judgment, quality assessment |
